	/*					Lambda
	 * 
	 * Uma interface funcional, tem apenas UM método ABSTRACT.
	 * 
	 * A functional interface is an interface that contains exactly one abstract
	 * method. It may contain zero or more default methods and/or static
	 * methods. Because a functional interface contains exactly one abstract
	 * method, you can omit the name of that method when you implement it using
	 * a lambda expression. For example, consider the following interface -
	 * interface Predicate<T> { boolean test(T t); }
	 * 
	 * The purpose of this interface is to provide a method that operates on an
	 * object of class T and return a boolean.
	 * 
	 * You could have a method that takes an instance of class that implements
	 * this interface defined like this - public void
	 * printImportantData(ArrayList<Data> dataList, Predicate<Data> p){ for(Data
	 * d: dataList){ if(p.test(d)) System.out.println(d); } }
	 * 
	 * where Data class could be as simple as public class Data{ public int
	 * value; }
	 * 
	 * Now, you can call the above method as follows:
	 * 
	 * printImportantData(al, (Data d)->{ return d.value>1; } ); Notice the lack
	 * of method name here. This is possible because the interface has only one
	 * abstract method so the compiler can figure out the name. This can be
	 * shortened to:
	 * 
	 * printImportantData(al, (Data d)->d.value>1); Notice the lack of curly
	 * brackets, the return keywordm, and the semicolon. This is possible
	 * because the method returns a boolean and the expression d.value>1 also
	 * returns a boolean. The compiler is therefore able to figure out that the
	 * value of this expression is to be returned from the method. This can be
	 * shortened even more to:
	 * 
	 * printImportantData(al, d->d.value>1); Notice that there is no declaration
	 * of d! The compiler can figure out all information it needs because the
	 * interface has only one abstract method and that method has only one
	 * parameter. So you don't need to write all those things in your code.
	 * 
	 * 
	 * Compare the above approach to the old style using an inner class that
	 * does the same thing -
	 * 
	 * printImportantData(al, new Predicate<Data>(){ public boolean test(Data
	 * d){ return d.value>1; } } );
	 * 
	 * The Predicate interface described above can be used anywhere there is a
	 * need to "do something with an object and return a boolean" and is
	 * actually provided by the standard java library in java.util.function
	 * package. This package provides a few other useful functional interfaces.
	 * 
	 * Predicate<T> Represents a predicate (boolean-valued function) of one
	 * argument of type T. Consumer<T> Represents an operation that accepts a
	 * single input argument of type T and returns no result. Function<T,R>
	 * Represents a function that accepts one argument of type T and produces a
	 * result of type R Supplier<T> Represents a supplier of results of type T.
	 * 
	 * For the exam, you only need to be aware of Predicate.
