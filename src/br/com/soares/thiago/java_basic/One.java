An instance member ...

TRUE  > can be a variable, a constant or a method.  
FALSE > is a variable or a constant.  
FALSE > belongs to the class.
TRUE  > belongs to an instance of the class.
FALSE > is same as a local variable.

variables defined in methods are called local variables (also known as automatic variables) 
where as instance members are defined in the class scope.
An instance member belongs to a single instance, not the class as a whole. 
An instance member is a member variable or a member method that belongs to a specific object instance. 
All non-static members are instance members.

Instancia membro, são os membros (Variavel, construtor e métodos) DO OBJETO e não da CLASSE
