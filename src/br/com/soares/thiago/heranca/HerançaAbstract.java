	// The extends keyword is used to specify inheritance.
	
	// subclass of a non-abstract class cannot be declared abstract.
	
	// subclass of an abstract class can be declared abstract.
	
	// subclass of a final class cannot be abstract.
	// final class cannot be subclassed.
	
	// A class, in which all the members are declared private, cannot be
	// declared public.
	// There is no such rule.
	
	// The extends clause is used to specify that a class extends another class
	// and thereby inherits all non-private instance members of that class.
	//
	// A subclass can be declared abstract regardless of whether the superclass
	// was declared abstract. A class cannot be declared abstract and final at
	// the same time. This restriction makes sense because abstract classes need
	// to be subclassed to be useful and final forbids subclasses.
	//
	// The visibility of the class is not limited by the visibility of its
	// members. A class with all the members declared private can still be
	// declared public or a class having all public members may be declared
	// private.
